    </p>

    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <p>For the stew:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 lbs (about 1 kg) oxtail, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>
        1 lb (about 500g) tripe (optional), cleaned and cut into bite-sized
        pieces
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon annatto powder or 2 tablespoons annatto seeds (dissolved in
        3 tablespoons water) - for color (optional)
      </li>
      <li>4 cups beef or bone broth</li>
      <li>1 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
      <li>1 medium eggplant, sliced diagonally</li>
      <li>1 bunch bok choy or pechay (Chinese cabbage)</li>
      <li>1/2 pound string beans, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the shrimp paste (bagoong):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup bagoong alamang (fermented shrimp paste)</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar (optional, for a touch of sweetness)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the shrimp paste (bagoong): In a small pan, heat the vegetable
        oil over medium heat. Saute the chopped onions and garlic until the
        onions are translucent. Add the bagoong alamang and cook for a few
        minutes until the mixture is heated through. If desired, add a touch of
        brown sugar for a slight sweetness. Remove from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Sear the
        oxtail and tripe (if using) until browned on all sides. Remove the meat
        from the pot and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pot, saut√© the chopped onions and minced garlic until
        fragrant and translucent. If using annatto seeds, add them with the
        water and let them simmer to extract the color. If using annatto powder,
        skip this step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the oxtail and tripe (if using) to the pot. Pour in the beef or
        bone broth, and bring it to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover
        the pot, and let it cook for about 2 to 3 hours or until the oxtail and
        tripe are tender. You can also use a pressure cooker to reduce the
        cooking time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the meat is tender, add the peanut butter to the pot, stirring it
        into the broth until well combined. Let it simmer for an additional 10
        minutes or until the sauce thickens. If the sauce is too thick, you can
        add more broth to reach your desired consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sliced eggplant, string beans, and bok choy (or pechay) to the
        pot. Continue to simmer until the vegetables are cooked but still
        slightly crisp. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the Kare-Kare hot with steamed rice and the prepared shrimp paste
        on the side. Enjoy this flavorful Filipino stew with family and friends!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Note: If you're short on time, you can also use pre-made Kare-Kare mix
      available in some specialty stores. However, preparing the stew from
      scratch with fresh ingredients will give you the best flavor.
