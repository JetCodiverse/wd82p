      <strong><em>Beef Mechado</em></strong> is a delicious Filipino stew made
      with tender beef, tomatoes, potatoes, and bell peppers. <br />The dish is
      traditionally cooked low and slow, allowing the flavors to meld together.
      <br />
      Here's a simple recipe for you to try:
    </p>

    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ lbs (680g) beef chuck or stewing beef, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups tomato sauce or pureed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons calamansi or lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 large potato, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Steamed rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven, heat the cooking oil over
        medium-high heat. Add the beef chunks and brown them on all sides. Work
        in batches if needed, so you don't overcrowd the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the browned beef from the pot and set it aside. In the same pot,
        sauté the chopped onion and minced garlic until the onion becomes
        translucent and the garlic is fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the browned beef back into the pot along with any accumulated
        juices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the tomato sauce or pureed tomatoes, beef broth, soy sauce,
        calamansi or lemon juice, brown sugar, and bay leaf. Stir to combine
        everything well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the
        pot and let the beef stew gently for about 1 ½ to 2 hours or until the
        beef becomes tender. Stir occasionally and check for seasoning, adding
        salt and pepper as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the beef is tender, add the potato chunks and sliced red bell
        pepper to the pot. Continue simmering until the potatoes are cooked
        through, which will take about 15 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning if required.</li>
      <li>Remove the bay leaf before serving.</li>
      <li>
        Serve the Beef Mechado over steamed rice and enjoy your flavorful
        Filipino stew!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Note: Mechado tends to taste even better when left to rest for a little
      while, so consider making it ahead of time and reheating it when ready to
      serve. The flavors will further develop and enhance with time.
